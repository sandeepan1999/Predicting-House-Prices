# Predicting Housing Prices using Regression

* A machine learning model that is trained on California Housing Prices dataset from the StatLib repository.

* We are doing supervised learning here and our aim is to do predictive analysis.

* Our model will help us in predicting future housing prices.

* Weâ€™ll validate it against our test dataset.

## The steps involved in the process are:

1. Understand the requirements of the business.

2. Acquire the dataset.

3. Visualize the data to understand it better and develop our intuition.

4. Pre-process the data to make it ready to feed to our ML model.

5. Try various models and train them. Select one that we find best.

6. Fine-tune our model by tuning hyper-parameters.

7. Present our solution.
